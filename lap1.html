                                    The cheetah  is a large cat of the subfamily Felinae that occurs in North, Southern and East Africa, and a few localities in Iran. It inhabits a variety of mostly arid habitats like dry forests, scrub forests, and savannahs.                             </p>

                                Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in the Upper Paleolithic period; carvings and 
                                paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves in France have been dated to 17,000 years ago, 
                                and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures that coincided 
                                with the lion's former and current ranges.
